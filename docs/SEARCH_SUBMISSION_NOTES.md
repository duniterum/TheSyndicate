# Search Submission Notes — The Syndicate

Updated: 2026-06-06 (pre-ads)

## Production endpoints

- **Production domain**: https://thesyndicate.money
- **Sitemap**: https://thesyndicate.money/sitemap.xml
- **Robots**: https://thesyndicate.money/robots.txt
- **Mirror (Lovable)**: https://syndicate-archive.lovable.app
- **Preview**: https://id-preview--ad47d0d6-2f40-4c25-bfe1-9939988d60df.lovable.app

The mirror and preview URLs are not the canonical search target. Submit only the production domain to search engines.

## Routes intended for indexing

`/`, `/join`, `/archive`, `/my-syndicate`, `/activity`, `/chapters`, `/liquidity`, `/members`, `/founders`, `/ranks`, `/registry`, `/transparency`, `/token`, `/tokenomics`, `/vault`, `/roadmap`, `/docs`, `/faq`, `/whitepaper`.

## Routes NOT to index

- `/labs` — quarantine for retired components. Blocked in `public/robots.txt` (`Disallow: /labs` and `Disallow: /labs/`) and excluded from `src/routes/sitemap[.]xml.ts`.

## Google Search Console — submission steps

1. Sign in at https://search.google.com/search-console with the Google account that owns the project.
2. Add property → **URL prefix** → `https://thesyndicate.money`.
3. Verify ownership. Preferred method: DNS TXT record at the domain registrar. Fallback: HTML meta tag (would require a code change on `__root.tsx` — defer until requested).
4. Sitemaps → Add a new sitemap → `sitemap.xml`.
5. URL Inspection: paste production URL of each important route and click **Request indexing** for: `/`, `/join`, `/archive`, `/my-syndicate`, `/transparency`, `/docs`, `/faq`, `/whitepaper`.
6. Coverage report: confirm `/labs` is reported as **Excluded by robots.txt** (expected, not an error).

## Bing Webmaster Tools — submission steps

1. Sign in at https://www.bing.com/webmasters.
2. Add a site → enter `https://thesyndicate.money`.
3. Verify ownership via DNS TXT, XML file, or meta tag. If Google Search Console is already configured, use **Import from GSC** to skip verification.
4. Sitemaps → Submit sitemap → `https://thesyndicate.money/sitemap.xml`.
5. URL Inspection: submit the same priority routes as GSC for indexing.

## Manual verification commands

```bash
curl -sI https://thesyndicate.money/robots.txt
curl -s  https://thesyndicate.money/robots.txt
curl -sI https://thesyndicate.money/sitemap.xml
curl -s  https://thesyndicate.money/sitemap.xml | grep -E "<loc>"
node scripts/check-route-status.mjs https://thesyndicate.money
```

## Notes

- No login or external setup performed in this pass — these are instructions only. Owner must complete GSC / Bing verification manually.
- Do not submit `/labs` URLs. They are intentionally blocked.
- Do not submit Lovable mirror or preview URLs — they would compete with the canonical domain.
